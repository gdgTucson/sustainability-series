                <p>
                    Deforestation and forest degradation, continued biodiversity loss and the ongoing degradation of 
                    ecosystems are having profound consequences for human well-being and survival. The world fell 
                    short on 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that, by 
                    threatening biodiversity, humanity threatens its own survival. While great efforts are being 
                    made to expand sustainable forest management, increase coverage of key biodiversity areas and sign 
                    up to legislation and treaties for protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, much more needs to be 
                    done to put the health of the planet at the centre of all plans and policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the rate of deforestation in tropical regions has slowed in the past decade, vigilance and 
                    targeted efforts are required to maintain this trend. The proportion of forest area fell from 31.9 
                    percent of total land area in 2000 to 31.2 percent in 2020, representing a net loss of almost 100 
                    million hectares of the world's forests. From 2000 to 2020, forest area increased in Asia, Europe 
                    and Northern America, but decreased significantly in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Despite 
                    the losses in forest cover, above-ground forest biomass per hectare, the proportion of forest area 
                    in protected areas and under long-term management plans, and certified forest area all increased or 
                    remained stable at the global level and in most of the regions of the world, demonstrating global 
                    progress towards sustainable forest management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, an average of 43 percent of each terrestrial key biodiversity area, 42 percent of each 
                    freshwater key biodiversity area, and 41 percent of each mountain key biodiversity area were within 
                    protected areas, an increase of 13 to 14 percentage points since 2000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of February 2021, 127 countries and territories had committed to setting voluntary targets for 
                    achieving land degradation neutrality, and 68 countries and territories had already officially 
                    endorsed their targets. Overall, commitments to land restoration are estimated to amount to 1 
                    billion hectares, of which 450 million hectares are covered by commitments through land 
                    degradation neutrality targets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data based on satellite imagery reveal that green coverage (forests, grasslands, croplands and 
                    wetlands) of the world's mountains remained steady at about 73 percent between 2000 and 2018. Green 
                    cover tends to be greater in mountain areas that are less than 2,500 metres above sea level. 
                    However, mountain green cover varies considerably across geographical regions, ranging from 100 
                    percent in Oceania to 68 percent in Northern Africa and Western Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Globally, the risk of species extinction has increased by about 10 percent over the past three 
                    decades. The <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/red-list-index" alt="Link to the Red 
                    List Index website.">Red List Index</a>, which ranges from a value of 1 to indicate no risk of 
                    extinction to a value of 0 to indicate the extinction of all species, decreased from 0.81 in 1993 
                    to 0.73 in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As at 1 February 2021, 128 countries, territories and the European Union had ratified the 
                    <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/" alt="Convention on Biological Diversity website.">Nagoya 
                    Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising 
                    from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity</a>, which is an increase of 60 
                    countries and territories since 2016, and 67 countries, territories and the European Union have 
                    shared information on their Nagoya Protocol frameworks. There are now 148 parties to the 
                    <a href="https://www.fao.org/plant-treaty/en/" alt="UN Food and Agriculture Organization website">
                    International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</a>, and so far, 57 
                    countries and territories have provided information about the measures that they have taken to 
                    implement the Nagoya Protocol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pandemic and the vast subsequent harm to human and economic well-being have starkly illustrated 
                    the potential global impact of zoonotic diseases, for which wildlife trade &mdash; both legal and 
                    illegal &mdash; is a potential vector. While certain markets for illegal wildlife products are 
                    declining, such as the market for ivory, which has decreased 3.5-fold since 2013, other species are 
                    under increasing threat as offenders shift their focus to more lucrative products, such as pangolin 
                    scales. In 2018, for example, there was a tenfold increase in the number of whole pangolin 
                    equivalents seized since 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nearly all countries and territories (98 per cent) have adopted national legislation for the 
                    prevention or control of invasive alien species, although there is wide variation in its coverage 
                    across sectors. The proportion of countries and territories aligning their targets for invasive 
                    alien species with global targets has increased, from 74 percent in 2016 to 84 percent in 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of March 2021, 89 countries and territories have implemented the system of environmental 
                    economic accounting, an increase of 29 percent since 2017. Of these, 62 countries and territories 
                    (70 percent) have integrated the system of accounting into their regular statistical production 
                    methods, and compile and publish the accounts on a regular basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, ODA from Development Assistance Committee members provided in support of biodiversity 
                    amounted to $6.6 billion, a decrease of 14 percent in real terms compared to 2018. In 2021, a total 
                    of 232 biodiversity-relevant taxes are in force across 62 countries and territories.
