                        Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move

                        taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their

                    Of the 13 indicators tracked as part of SDG 12, only two have data availbale on the 
                    <a href="https://sdg.data.gov/responsible-consumption-and-production/" 
                    alt="SDG 12 indicators statistics page.">SDG 12 statistics page</a>. One (12.2.2) shows that
                    personal consumption per capita had been rising steadily as of 2016. The other indicator (12.4.1) 
                    showed that the US was still submitting reports in accord with the Montreal Protocol on Substances. 
                    The Montreal Protocol is concerned with ozone-depleting substances.
